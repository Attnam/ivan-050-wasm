April 23 2003 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Silva's boulders now destroy neither altars, stairs nor any other important
	  terrain
	* Eddies no longer spit couches over irreplacable terrain

	* Removed the insult for pressing an unrecognized key
	* Kicking now uses a random leg so that both legs are trained
	* Hit order using two weapons or fists is now unpredictable
	* Fixed a rounding error that freezed leg strength when burdened and doubled
	  agility exp minus
	* Hitting or blocking with a two-handed weapon now gives strength exp to both
	  arms
	* Reduced exp gained in battle to counterbalance these changes
	* Being satiated (and not moving) again reduces agility exp; I don't know
	  if this makes agility too difficult to train, but let's test it
	* Nonhumanoids now gain strength exp from biting
	* Kicking now gives no exp if there is no character in the kicked square,
	  since this could be abused
	* Added many new material configs for thunder hammers
	* The holy banana of Oily Orpiv is now more accurate, does greater damage,
	  burns enemies, shoots fireballs when zapped (that's "oily" after all)
	  and explodes with the power of an atomic bomb when damaged, making it a
	  fierce weapon of mass destruction
	* The holy banana now emits bright light
	* The holy banana now greatly trains all attributes when eaten
	* Broken shield's wielded picture added to humanoid.pcx by Kahvi and

	  cannot hit the user (well, unless he is fighting a ghost inside a wall)
	* Difficulty now cannot decrease even if the player becomes lousier than
	  before, since this could be abused by running naked around locked rooms
	  to cheat the monster generation code
	* Quickdeath prevention system no longer affects unique monsters, and
	  their danger modifiers have been decreased; these changes seem to make

	* Version updated to 0.411
	* SeeWholeMapCheat is now more versatile
	* Corrected a bug that prevented doors to be created on the right and left sides
