<entry incomplete>

	* It is no longer possible to kick stones under walls
	* It is no longer possible to detect traps by floating over them, dropping
	  items and checking if the total weight of the stack is greater than the
	  items' weights' sum

January 6 2004 Heikki Sairanen <firstname.lastname@tut.fi>

	* Now compiles in linux. The corrections are _bad_ so checking them wouldn't be a bad idea.
	
January 1 2004 Timo Kiviluoto <firstname.lastname@hut.fi>

	* Fixed a problem that caused the fluid system to run occasionally very slowly

	* Prevented crystals from spawning over stairs in UT4

January 1 2004 Timo Kiviluoto <firstname.lastname@hut.fi>

	* Corrected an extremely fatal bug in the square destruction code (it may
	  have caused random crashes when changing levels)
	* Fixed a harmless light update absence bug in the cloning code
	* N simultaneously bought items in a shop can no longer cost more than N
	  times one item's price (formelly this was possible since all arithmetic
	  operations during the price calculations were rounded down)
	* Monsters now avoid needlessly stepping on banana peels and broken bottles
	* The nationality adjective "Attnamian" is now written "Attnamese"
	* Gear pictures are now updated correctly when an equipped item spoils
	* Adjusted the word order of sword names (based on our weapon expert Kahvi's
	  opinions)
	* The game no longer enters an infinite loop when blood is spilled on an
	  enner beast's groin
	* It is now possible to determine the leader of a team in the script
	* It is now possible to determine how spoiled items are in the script
	* Adding several identical items in the script is now more elegant
	* Remade the consume system: the game now handles correctly situations
	  where the player eg. eats an iron sword with a banana flesh handle
	* Ikiros can now remove rust from equipment
	* Fixed two bugs in Loricatus's pray effect
	* Optimized the generation of terrains and items somewhat
	* Added many new features to New Attnam
	  * Banana shop for the hungry (the products start to spoil within a few
	    turns, though)
	  * Priestess of Silva who offers the same services as the priest in
	    Attnam but is cheaper
	  * Tourist family who follow Kaethos around the town
	  * Underground sumo wrestling arena, where the player can compete with
	    the local sumo champion Huang Ming Pong (I will not list all the
	    meticulous details of the associated events here)
	  * Added two new armors which the player gets after winning the sumo
	    fight
	  * The banana growers now feed the sumo wrestler regularily
	  * It now rains in the village occasionally
	* Lowered the player's starting money
	* Zombies raised by necromancers now inherit the attributes of their
	  past lives; also their names now depend on them
	* Master necromancers can now sometimes raise Xinroch, if he hasn't
	  been generated yet
	* Apprentice necromancers can now raise any corpse he sees as a zombie
	  (not just an adjacent one), and masters any corpse in the level
	* Necromancers are now somewhat more intelligent

December 16 2003 Timo Kiviluoto <firstname.lastname@hut.fi>

	* Adjusted the colors of menus and lists so that the selected item is
	  more clearly visible on dark monitors
	* Large spider, giant spider and Lada added to char.pcx by Kahvi
	* Expensive camera and miniature mummy of Lenin added to item.pcx by Kahvi
	* Necromancer, bourgeois tourist, his wife and child, and Lenin added to
	  humanoid.pcx by Kahvi
	* Necromancer graphics integrated
	* Two spider webs added to effect.pcx by Kahvi
	* Remade felist entry picture drawing system; browsing an enormous inventory
	  (for instance after using the gain all items cheat) is now a lot faster
	* A small typo in the look description of neutral panicked NPCs corrected
	* Added a super-fast system for retrieving random pixels for which a certain
	  predicate (say, non-transparency) is true; I plan to use a similiar
	  algorithm for level::RandomSquare in the future
	* Documented stack.h/cpp and fluid.h/cpp
	* Added ironalloy material category which currently consists of iron, steel,
	  meteoric steel and adamant
	* Iron alloys can now rust; names and strength values are affected
	* Rusting is now displayed graphically as random brown pixels
	* Added RustModifier material database member which determines the ability
	  to rust for liquids and how easily rusting happens for ironalloys
	* Golems and terrains made of ironalloys can also rust
	* Scroll of repair can now remove rust
	* Renamed class human to playerkind
	* Rewrote the player's armor drawing code; it was probably the most horrible
		gum solution in the entire game
	* Added several item database members to control which armor pictures
	  are to be drawn
	* Added (half-accidentally) support for armor picture animations
	* The Shirt of the Golden Eagle now gives the player an appropriate blue aura
	  when worn
	* The priority map trickery which is used to determine the special effect
	  drawing order of humanoids is now completely incomprehensible
	* Remade the whole fluid code: it now utilizes the full power of IVAN's
	  material system
	  * Liquids on ground can now cause effects to legs/other bodyparts
	  * An arbitrary number of fluids can now cover weapons, armor and
	    bodyparts; graphical effects added to item pictures
	  * Fluids can now affect the items and bodyparts they cover
	  * Removed the obsolete ContainedMaterial of weapons
	  * Fluid is now displayed over wielded, armor and bodypart graphics
	    for playerkinds; however I chose not to show them for other monsters
	    since it could cause many characters to be drawn very unclearly
	    from the user's perpective
	  * Added a dripping animation for all fluids not on ground
	  * Damaging a monster with a weapon now causes blood to be spilled
	    over the item used
	  * Dipping to solid materials is alas no longer possible; however, I
	    haven't done this since 0.311 so it isn't so great a loss
	  * Liquids can now exist on non-walkable terrain and affect them.
	    For instance you can destroy walls using acid (see below).
	    However, there is a small problem that liquids can be seen from
	    all sides of the terrain which can be strange if it is a part of a
	    long wall separating parallel tunnels
	  * Fluids can now emit light (but this feature is not yet used)
	* A potion which breaks due to hitting an object now spills half of
	  its contents to the next square on its theoretical line of flight
	* Fluids affected by paranormal gravitational distractions now land
	  correctly on the players face, if he/she/it has one
	* Corpses now spill blood, not just severed bodyparts
	* Added acid effects which are based on the Acidicity material database
	  member; acidous fluids cause items to break and can destroy very weak
	  broken items, and they also tend to be very rusting
	* Added IsImmuneToAcid material database boolean
	* Dark frog blood and pepsi are now acidous
	* Remade the vomit system; the amount of liquid now depends on the body
	  volume of the character and it can be targeted to adjacent squares
	  and used as a very poor acid-based weapon
	* Added BloodMaterial and VomitMaterial character database members
	* Mommos now really attack by vomiting acidous slime, which also has
	  a high RustModifier
	* Oree's vomit attack now really spills acidous blood over the player
	* M-color 3 of arm pictures is henceforth allocated for gauntlets;
	  some humanoid graphics updated due to this
	* Zombies now spoil

November 8 2003 Heikki Sairanen <firstname.lastname@tut.fi>

	* feio.cpp documented

August 31 2003 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>
	
	* Now compiles with gcc
	* Added necromancers
	* Mushrooms inherit their stats.
	* Atavus gives player a banana at XMas. Banana should probably be changed to something else.

August 14 2003 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

	* Certain small changes to mihail so it know finds it's missing FeLib...

	Added instructions to create symbolic link to FeLib, if it isn't distributed for the user.

August 14 2003 Timo Kiviluoto <markku.kiviluoto@sono.fimnet.fi>

	* Added some comments to the Febot code
	* Hex's new MIHAIL version added to CVS

August 14 2003 Timo Kiviluoto <markku.kiviluoto@sono.fimnet.fi>

	* iosystem::StringQuestion now takes the destination string as an argument
	  and returns whether the user aborted the question or not
	* Configuration system has been standardized and moved largely to FeLib
	* Added Febot engine which can be used by the Oracle of the Holy Haven of Gurus
	  when the time comes
