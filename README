4. FAQ

Q: What does "Iter Vehemens ad Necem" mean?

A: It's latin and means a "Violent Road to Death".

Q: Why can't I make multiple saves and why is my save deleted when I die?

A: Like the creators of other roguelikes, we think this makes
gaming much more exciting, since you must take full responsibility
of all your actions. You have only one chance to live or die.
Usually the latter, as the name suggests.

Q: What do these strange markings like Dex, Agi mean in
right sidebar?

A: 
ArmStr = Arm Strength - Increases damage inflicted on enemies
LegStr = Leg Strength - Increases carrying capacity and kicking damage
Dex = Dexterity - Increases accuracy and hit speed
Agi = Agility - Increase movement speed and ability to dodge attacks
End = Endurance - Increases maximum health points and healing rate
Per = Perception - Increases sight range and accuracy
Int = Intelligence - Increases your ability to read and learn
Wis = Wisdom - Increases your ability to deal with gods
Cha = Charisma - Improves your ability to negotiate and make deals
Siz = Size or height
HP = Health Points - The sum of your bodyparts' HPs
Gold = The amount of money you have
Time = The turns you have used in this game

Q: I had 20 HPs, but I still died. Is this a bug?

A: No, this is not a bug. You will die (at least in human-form) if
your HPs of your groin, torso or head reach 0.

Q: Why do I always miss spiders with my trusty iron mace?

A: Mace is far too big for hitting small creatures. Do
you really kill spiders with large objects in real life?

Q: What do marks like L+, C-- mean in the pray menu?

A: All gods have a property that tells whether they are
supporters of Law or Chaos or if they are Neutral. This is
however too general description so the plusses and minuses
tell of slight differences between the gods. Eg Valpurus
has the letters L++ this means that Valpurus is extremely
lawful, when Sophos has the letters L-, which in turn means
that Sophos is lawful, but still leaning a bit towards
neutrality and even chaos.

Q: I just loosed a leg. How do I get it back?

A: Certain gods, potions and special characters may help you.

Q: How can I compile IVAN source code?

A: See INSTALL.
  
Q: I've found a bug. What should I do?

A: Write a small description on how the bug occured and
if possible even how we could replicate it and send this
information by email to ivan-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
If you are a SourceForge user, you can also report
this bug at Ivan's SourceForge project page:

Q: I've got a great idea to make IVAN better! What should I do?

A: Describe the idea to us by sending it to 
ivan-users@lists.sourceforge.net or report it at Ivan's
SourceForge project page (see above).

Q: I'm a programmer willing to help you. What should I do?

A: Code and then send us (e-mail: ivan-devel@lists.sourceforge.net)
your diff. If we like your code we will integrate it to the next
release. You will of course be credited for your code.
