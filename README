1. Description

Iter Vehemens ad Necem (IVAN) is a graphical roguelike game,
which currently runs in Windows, DOS and Linux. Its most
innovative parts at the moment are its material handling
system and its lighting system.

-----------------------------

2. System requirements

The game *works* on quite slow systems, but we recommend that
use at least a:

	Pentium 233 MHz
	48 Megs of RAM

	Windows 9x/ME/XP/2000 (at least)
	DirectX 8

	or:

	DOS
	Vesa 2.0 compatible video card

	or:
	
	Linux with 
	(SDL library version 1.0.0 or higher)

-----------------------------

3. General gameplay

IVAN works pretty much in the same way as other roguelikes 
(Nethack, Adom, Slash'em etc...). The player controls a 
character. The player moves from the direction keys.
All other commands can be found by pressing ?-key in the
game.

4. FAQ (nobody that we know of really asks these questions, but we like to 
think that somebody does)

Q: What do marks like L+, C-- mean in the pray menu?

A: All gods have a property that tells whether they are supporters
of Law or Chaos or if they are neutral. This is however too general
description so the plusses and minuses tell of slight differences 
between the gods. Eg Valpurus has the letters L++ this means that
Valpurus is extremely lawful, when Sophos has the letters L-, which in
turn means that Sophos is lawful, but still leaning a bit towards
neutrallity and even chaos.


Q: What do these strange markings like Dex, Agi mean in right sidebar?

A: 
	ArmStr = Arm Strength - Increases damage inflicted on enemies
	LegStr = Leg Strength - Increases carrying capacity and kicking damage
 	Dex = Dexterity - Increases accuracy and hit speed
	Agi = Agility - Increase movement speed and ability to dodge attacks
	End = Endurance - Increases Maximum health points
	Per = Perception - Increases sight range and accuracy
	Int = Intelligence - Increase ability to read
	Wis = Wisdom - 
	Cha = Charisma - Increases your social skills and improves your ability to make deals  
	Siz = Size or height
	HP = Health Points - The sum of your bodyparts' (head, torso, groin, arms and legs) HPs
	Gold = the money you have 
	Time = The turns you have used in this game


Q: I had 20 HPs, but I still died. Is this a bug?

A: No, this is not a bug. You will die (at least in human-form) if your HPs of your groin, 
torso or head reach 0.


Q: Why do I always miss spiders with my trusty iron mace?

A: Mace is far too big for hitting small creatures. Do
you really kill spiders with large objects in real life?


Q: I just loosed a leg. How do I get it back?

A: Certain gods, potions and special characters may help 
you.

  
Q: I've found a bug. What should I do?

A: Write a small description on how the bug occured and
if possible even how we could replicate it and send this
information by email to ivan-users@sourceforge.net.
If you are a SourceForge user, you can also report
this bug at Ivan's SourceForge project page:

Q: I've got a great idea to make IVAN better! What should
I do?

A: Describe the idea to us by sending it to 
ivan-users@sourceforge.net or report it at Ivan's
SourceForge project page (see above).


Q: I'm a programmer willing to help you. What should I do?

A: Code and then send us (e-mail: ivan-devel@lists.sourceforge.net)
your diff. If we like your code we will integrate it to the next
release. You will of course be credited for your code.
