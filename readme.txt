1. Description

Iter Vehemens ad Necem (IVAN) is a graphical roguelike game. 
IVAN has been ported to Windows and DOS and a Linux port is 
more than likely. The most innovative parts at the moment 
are the material handling system and the lighting system.

-----------------------------

2. System requirements

The game *works* in quite slow machines, but we recommend that
use atleast a:

	Pentium 233 MHz
	48 Megs of RAM
	Windows 95
	DirectX 8

-----------------------------

3. General gameplay

IVAN works pretty much in the same way as other roguelikes 
(Nethack, Adom, Slash'em etc...). The player controls a 
character. The player moves from the direction keys.
All other commands can be found by pressing ?-key in the
game.

A: Write a small description on how the bug occured and
if possible even how we could replicate it and it by
email to ivan-users@sourceforge.net

I do?

Q: I'm a programmer and I would like to help you. 
What should I do?

A: Currently we are using Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 and
we accept the fact that most people don't have it on there
machines. We currently looking at ways to port this to
gcc and Mingw32. If you happen to have Microsoft Visual
C++ 5.0 or you are intrested in porting IVAN to other platforms
or other compilers contact us at ivan-users@sourceforge.net.
