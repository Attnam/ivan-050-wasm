1. Description

Iter Vehemens ad Necem (IVAN) is a graphical roguelike game.
IVAN currently runs in Windows but a Linux port is more than
likely. Its most innovative parts at the moment are the
material handling system and the lighting system.

-----------------------------

2. System requirements

The game *works* on quite slow systems, but we recommend that
use atleast a:

	Pentium 233 MHz
	48 Megs of RAM
	Windows 95
	DirectX 8

-----------------------------

3. General gameplay

IVAN works pretty much in the same way as other roguelikes 
(Nethack, Adom, Slash'em etc...). The player controls a 
character. The player moves from the direction keys.
All other commands can be found by pressing ?-key in the
game.

Q: I've got a great idea to make IVAN better! What should
I do?

A: Describe the idea to us by sending it to 
ivan-users@sourceforge.net or report it at Ivan's
SourceForge project page (see above).

Q: I'm a programmer and I would like to help you. 
What should I do?

A: Currently we are using Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0/6.0 and
we accept the fact that most people don't have either on their
machines. We are currently searching for ways to port this to
gcc and Mingw32. If you happen to have Microsoft Visual
C++ 5.0/6.0 or you are interested in porting IVAN to other
platforms or other compilers contact us at ivan-users@sourceforge.net.
