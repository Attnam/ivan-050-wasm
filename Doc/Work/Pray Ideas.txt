(*)  Some people use to pray for their deity in real life when it is left for fortune to decide
     the success of important events. This would be a similiar command, and it would be separated
     from the normal praying. It is done silently and so the deity often doesn't notice it,
     but chances for angering gods by overusing it would also be very low.
(**) We can't use the old sacrifice & convert system unmodified, since the player has many friend
     gods and only one can receive the altar. I propose this: normaly you cannot pray in an altar
     room to anyone else than the owner. However, when the command is selected directly over the
     altar, you are asked whether you want to try to convert the altar. If you don't, you will pray
     to the owner with some special bonuses (you are on the deity's altar, anyway). If you do, you
     must make a sacrifice to another god you select. If he/she thinks it's worthy enough, he/she
     will figth the owner of the altar room for it's control.
     This could also be an independent command, since receiving altar bonuses when praying may
     become a habit for some players, and so the "Do you want to convert the altar?" prompt would
     become quite annoying.
