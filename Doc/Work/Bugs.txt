//Polymorphed into a mistress warlady and wielding the Justifier, I attacked Attnam. After killing a dozen citizens inside
  and outside the Cathedral, I noticed odd lagging, activated the see whole map cheat and discovered Petrus had gone mad
  and was killing everyone. I suppose some item kicked by guard hit him and he thought Attnam's folk had started a rebellion?
  A funny side note: a kamikaze dwarf had just blown up his wives, which would perhaps be a humane reason for his actions :)

//Guards in the library.
//(example) Even though the golem is not seen the message "The attack of the glass golem interrupts you." is displayed
