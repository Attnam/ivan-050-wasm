    How to create a new project in IVAN workspace, step by step tutorial

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<project> == name of the new project

1. Create a subfolder named "<project>" into the IVAN main directory.
2. Create empty subfolders named "Source" and "Include" to the "<project>"
   folder.
3. Create the new project to IVAN workspace with VC++. Choose your IVAN
   folder as the folder of the project, *not* IVAN/<project> as Visual
   Studio suggests. If your project is a library, make it dependent of
   "Main".
4. Go to project settings.
   4.1. In the "General" sheet, place "<project>/" in the beginning of
	the text in "Intermediate files:" and "Output files:" textboxes.
	Do this to both Debug and Release modes.
   4.2. In the "C/C++" sheet, choose category "Preprocessor" and place
	the following text into the "Additional include directories" text
	box: "Include,Main/Include, <project>/Include", and after that all
	Include directories of all projects currently in the workspace.
   4.3. Add the "<project>/Include" into all other projects' Include
	settings.
   4.4. If your project is a library, switch to project settings of Main
	Debug and add "<project>/Debug/<project>.lib" to "Link"->"General"->
	"Object/library modules", and "<project>/Release/<project>.lib" to
	the same place in Main Release. Do this also to all other
	exe-producing projects, like LibTest, if they need your project.
5. Add a folder named "Source" to the project, and choose file extensions
   "c,cc,cpp". Do the same for "Include", with file extensions "h,hh,hpp".
6. Add or create your needed files to the project. They will be
   automatically placed into appropriate directories.
7. Begin programming.
