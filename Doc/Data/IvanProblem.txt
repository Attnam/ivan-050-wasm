Ur-Khan the orc marshal has appeared way too early in GC level 6.
The situation map:

#### ####
#### ####
#### ####	# = moraine earth
    G  U	@ = you
####@####	G = your pet adamant golem
#### ####	U = orc marshal
#### ####

You have a scroll of taming and all wands.
Reading the scroll takes two turns.
You cannot survive for more than one turn if Ur-Khan concentrates his attacks on you.
How can you capture him?
